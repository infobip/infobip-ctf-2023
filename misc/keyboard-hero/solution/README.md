# Solution

Simple programming challenge where one needs to echo back the current character sent by the server before the timeout happens. The script takes a few minutes since spaces are basically blanks and are equivalent to a pause (nothing should be sent to the server).

Solution is in `solve.py`:
```
$ python3 solve.py 
[+] Opening connection to 172.17.0.2 on port 9000: Done
ibctf{1f-th3-PC_1z_n0t-c0mpl41n1ng-y0ur3_n0t-h1tt1ng_l0ud-en0ugh}
[*] Closed connection to 172.17.0.2 port 9000
```
